    "text": "When I took Cultural Reporting with Jesse Holland, he challenged us to cover a community that we were not a part of for the whole semester; I decided to report on the disabled community at GW. The class taught me the importance of listening, advocating and challenging your preconceived notions. Below is the op-ed I wrote for the class arguing for increased accessibility on GW’s campus. I spoke with members of the disabled community to learn more about their experiences with accessibility on campus, as well as GW administrators to understand what the school is doing to improve the quality of life for students with disabilities.\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nNora Hoffman is a junior at George Washington University studying political science and english. She is hard of hearing. To accommodate her disability, GW provides live captioning done by a third party individual in her classes. The person doing live captioning is known as a communications access real-time translation, CART, provider. \nThe Friday before the start of the semester, Hoffman received an email from Disability Support Services alerting her that her captioner would be online for the entire semester. However, the technology needed for the CART provider to perform services online was not readily available. \nAccording to Hoffman, a mic and receiver are also necessary for the CART provider to caption virtually — it was not until 6 weeks into the semester that those tools were provided. \nHoffman replied to the email telling students the service would be online and asked why they hadn't heard this earlier. \nDr. Maggie Butler, the Director Disability Support Services/Office of Diversity, Equity, and Community Engagement, called her on the phone in an attempt to explain the situation. Hoffman, who is hard of hearing, can not take phone calls. \nHoffman said that this action was a \"disconnect\" on behalf of DSS. \n\"I just wish they would prioritize disabled students and accessibility more,\" Hoffman said.\nWhen The George Washington University went online in March 2020, the administration quickly had to make adaptations and accommodations for \"virtual learning.\" The university remained operational entirely online for nearly two years. Throughout the period of virtual learning, accommodations were quickly made for the sake of both the physical and mental well-being of students at the university. These accommodations contributed to the wellbeing and academic success of students given the ongoing crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic.  \nMany of these accommodations have remained or been adapted to in-person learning as the university came back in the fall of 2021. However, there are many students who have disabilities, both visible and invisible, that have needed similar accommodations well before March 2020.\nIt is imperative that the accommodations implemented as a result of the pandemic are maintained and supported despite the crisis no longer being as immediate. \nIn the past year, virtual learning accommodations have benefited the entire student population, demonstrating that accessibility improves everyone's collective well-being.  Accessibility for students with disabilities should not be implemented only when it assists the able-bodied majority on campus. It is too late for the administration to correct these wrongs in making appropriate accommodations for those who needed it prior to the pandemic; however, it is of the utmost importance that they continue making accessibility a priority as they have demonstrated in the past year. Furthermore, this is an opportunity for the university to expand accessibility on campus both inside and outside the classroom for those with physical or other disabilities.\nAccommodations such as having lecture slides posted to Blackboard was once seen as too much to ask for by students who faced physical limitations to being in the classroom. Now, GW requires professors to record and post lectures in case a sick student cannot come to class - even if \"sick\" is just a mild cold.\nShira Strongin is a senior at George Washington. She started school in the fall of 2017, but had to medically withdraw when she was unable to attend classes in person as a result of her chronic illness.\n\nWhen she started to miss classes her freshman year as a result of her illness, she said the administration at GW was unwilling to allow her professors to record lectures or send her class material such as lecture powerpoints. Those are both standard practices now. \n\"When I was asking for these my freshmen year, none of this [the pandemic] had happened,\" said Strongin. \"They [the administration] said that they couldn't and there was no precedent for it. And they were right about precedent, but they weren't right about couldn't. So now there's no excuse.\"\nStrongin said it is deeply frustrating to think back on all the excuses they gave to her when she was struggling.\n\"There clearly were solutions, they just weren't willing.\" said Strongin.\nMany accommodations given the pandemic's impact have carried over to in-person learning. Professors are regularly recording lectures and uploading recordings to Blackboard sites. This sort of standard-practice accommodation was not offered to those with disabilities who needed it before. Students and professors are also now required to wear masks to every class and in university buildings. More people wearing masks means less illness overall, especially during \"sick seasons.\" For students with compromised immune systems, this adaptation allows them to feel more comfortable in classrooms. These contrasts begs the question of why accessibility only becomes relevant when it means accessibility for abled-bodied individuals. \nBefore the shift in culture as a result of the pandemic, it was commonplace for students to present evidence such as a doctor's note explaining why they had to miss class. This sort of behavior may be uncomfortable for students and also singles out those with disabilities - specifically those that they may not be particularly visible. Now, professors are much more accommodating toward students who feel sick to any degree. It has been common practice to skip class for something mild as a sore throat should so as to not put the entire class at risk for Covid-19.\nWhen Covid-19 sent students home abruptly in March 2020, the university granted a pass/no pass option with no limit on how many classes it could be applied to. Therefore, a student could take any class pass/no pass and had until the end of the grading period to decide. In the following academic year, GW maintained the policy but it was only applicable for one class. A pass/no pass meant that the grade would have no bearing on a student's grade point average [GPA]. This accommodation helped students who may have been dealing with outside emotional stressors of being at home during the pandemic. It is naive of the university to think that now that classes are back in person, outside factors that may have made a student more inclined to take a class pass/no pass are suddenly non-existent. Therefore, the policy should still remain.\nThe change in culture and the adaption of many accommodations both through virtual learning and as the university has returned to in person learning is a result of the pandemic. Nonetheless, their ability to implement such accommodations for nearly 11,000 undergraduates makes it clear that they could have done so for the smaller, minority population of students with disabilities who would have benefited immensely from the expanded levels of accessibility. Their inability to do so is a reflection of systemic and institutional biases against students and people with disabilities. GW now has an opportunity to do better, and they should keep these accommodations in place and continue providing for students, both able-bodied and with disabilities, so as to provide the most accessible means of education for all individuals."

    "text": "In spring 2021, I took state and urban policy problems with Professor Betz. The class explored policy issues in state and local governments. We explored topics such as infrastructure, budget allocation, and poverty. For our final, we had to write a policy brief to a local official from our home state urging a particular piece of legislation be passed. I wrote my brief encouraging my state senator to pass a bill that would require comprehensive sex education be taught in all New York public schools. You can read more about my research into how comprehensive sex education can lower teen pregnancy rates, STI infections among teens and promote positive health outcomes for young people in New York. I’ve included my statement of purpose and recommendation to my state senator.\n\nTitle: Implementing Comprehensive Sex Education in Public Schools for New York Senator Alessandra Biaggi, District 34\nPolicymaker: Senator Alessandra Biaggi of District 34 in New York.\nStatement of the Issue:\nComprehensive sex education yields positive sexual health outcomes such as lower rates of teen pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections among adolescents. Comprehensive sex education is unlike the pro-abstinence curriculum that is widely implemented in schools across America. Studies have shown that sex education that emphasizes solely abstinence is statistically ineffective.  \nNew York’s current sexual education curriculum is not effective at yielding positive sexual health outcomes, making the issue of comprehensive sex education apparent and urgent. New York has above the national average rates of teen pregnancy and abortion. Of the STI cases in New York State, adolescents aged 15-19 makeup half.  Assembly Bill 1904, which had a duplicate bill in the Senate, sought to “require the commissioner to establish a comprehensive sex education curriculum to be taught in grades 1-12,” and failed this past year. The events of this past year, however, underscore the need for the issue of comprehensive sex education to be raised.  For example, since many states issued statewide lockdowns, people were forced into isolation and were sometimes confined to unhealthy living conditions including residing with abusers. Studies have found a drastic increase in reports of domestic abuse and intimate partner violence.  \nEnacting legislation to improve sexual education curriculum would have far-reaching positive effects on the general well-being of marginalized adolescent communities that make up District 34, in particular. Data suggests that kids in these schools would greatly benefit from a diverse, culturally sensitive, comprehensive sexual education curriculum.  The lack of comprehensive sex education in schools directly correlates to students’ negative sexual health and developmental wellbeing. Comprehensive sex education yields results that foster tangible positive outcomes for students such as better grades and test results. Research on well rounded education on issues such as contraceptive use, sexuality, and healthy relationships has proven to reduce risky behavior by adolescents and yield positive health outcomes in students. There is an urgent need to implement comprehensive sex education curriculum in public schools across New York state’s 34th district.\nRecommendation\nComprehensive sex education in schools across New York’s 34th district would include education on healthy relationships, promote sexual wellbeing education and be responsive to the needs of students of different backgrounds. To effectively mitigate negative sexual health outcome among adolescents in New York State it is imperative that a comprehensive sex education curriculum is mandated in the public schools. Schools should not have the option to teach sex education and it should therefore have a comprehensive curriculum that follows the guidelines of institutions whose standards are grounded in research and data. The California’s model uses curriculum written by different organizations such as Positive Prevention Plus. This proposed policy suggests that the best method for New York’s implementation would be to follow the curriculum set forth by SIECUS’ National Sex Education Standards (Second Edition). Requiring this curriculum from 6th through 12th grade, as done similarly in California, is the best method of implementation as well to bypass potential political confrontation on the matter as well as yield the most positive sexual health outcome by targeting a particularly vulnerable age demographic. \nTo achieve the most equitable implementation, there should be a piece of this proposed policy which allocates funds specifically for low-income schools and marginalized communities in district 34, as modeled by the Colorado plan. This method ensures that communities which face disproportionate rates of negative health outcomes such as teen pregnancy get the education on preventative measures and consequential resources.\nTo be most successful in the given moment, supplementing curriculum with resources through online sources such as AMAZE is a viable option for this proposed policy. As the implementation could require extended time for teacher training and designation of funds for specific resources needed for a comprehensive sex education, utilizing these free resources is technically feasible and most timely. The result of this proposed policy will be tremendous for students in Senator Biaggi’s district 34. It is of the utmost importance that students feel uplifted, valued, and empowered to make decisions about their sexual health, personal identity, and interpersonal relationships. By implementing a policy that provides the tools to empower such students it is without question that negative health outcomes currently plaguing New York State’s youth will decline steadily."

But let’s get more specific with what we’d like to see.\nFiltering and sorting is a way to manipulate data in R in order to pull exact information from a data set.\nAs an example, let’s try to find information only for cars with 6 cylinders. Make sure to use “==” when trying to find the variable that you’d like to single out. A single = will not produce code.\n\nfilter(carsdata, cyl == 6)\n\n                mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nMazda RX4      21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.620 16.46  0  1    4    4\nMazda RX4 Wag  21.0   6 160.0 110 3.90 2.875 17.02  0  1    4    4\nHornet 4 Drive 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nValiant        18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nMerc 280       19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C      17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\nFerrari Dino   19.7   6 145.0 175 3.62 2.770 15.50  0  1    5    6\n\n\nGreat job! This code essentially says filter the dataset called carsdata for only cars that have 6 cylinders.\nWe still haven’t changed the original table. In order to do that you’d have to save it as a new object. Since we only told R to filter by cars with 6 cylinders, that’s what it did. But it turns out that’s still a lot of cars.\nSide Note: If you need to know what each variable in mtcars stands for use the Help tool in R. Search “mtcars” then you can find what each variable means. For example, am stands for transmission. It is a binary, categorical variable which means that if it 0 the car is automatic and if it’s 1 the car is manual. Try using the Help tool in R to find what each variable means.\nNow, let’s try filtering for multiple things in the dataset. Let’s find all cars that have 6 cylinders and are automatic. This will make our dataset even more specific. Make sure to use a comma between the two variables in order to separate them.\n\nfilter(carsdata, cyl == \"6\", am == \"0\")\n\n                mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nHornet 4 Drive 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nValiant        18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nMerc 280       19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C      17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\n\n\nAmazing! There’s only 4 cars with both of these characteristics. This dataset is from the 1970s, today there might be more automatic cars with 6 cylinders.\nNow, let’s introduce a tool that will make all of this a tad easier, the gorgeous pipe function.\nThe “pipe” %>% operator allows you to chain together commands. It can be more intuitive as you try to think through each step. The command for it is “CMD SHIFT M” on Macs, “CTRL SHIFT M” for PCs.\nLet’s identify the exact same variables as above (cylinders, and automatic/manual) using the pipe operator.\n\ncarsdata %>% \n  filter(cyl == \"6\", am == \"0\")\n\n                mpg cyl  disp  hp drat    wt  qsec vs am gear carb\nHornet 4 Drive 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.08 3.215 19.44  1  0    3    1\nValiant        18.1   6 225.0 105 2.76 3.460 20.22  1  0    3    1\nMerc 280       19.2   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.30  1  0    4    4\nMerc 280C      17.8   6 167.6 123 3.92 3.440 18.90  1  0    4    4\n\n\nGreat!

So let’s put it all together and only find automatic cars with 6 cylinders in the data set, arranged by weight and without concern for some other irrelevant variables (such as number of carburetors).\n\ncarsdata %>% \n  filter(cyl == \"6\", am == \"0\") %>% \n  arrange(desc(wt)) %>% \n  select(mpg, cyl, disp, hp, wt)\n\n                mpg cyl  disp  hp    wt\nValiant        18.1   6 225.0 105 3.460\nMerc 280       19.2   6 167.6 123 3.440\nMerc 280C      17.8   6 167.6 123 3.440\nHornet 4 Drive 21.4   6 258.0 110 3.215\n\n\nAmazing work! So what you have done here is create a dataset that filters and sorts for specific variables. In addition to this sorting and filtering, we created a dataframe that doesn’t include relevant variables (in a hypothetical sense). If this was being used for research, it would be helpful to the audience in order to take only relevant information and apply it for whatever conclusions one was seeking to make sense of."

    "text": "When I took Cultural Reporting with Jesse Holland, he challenged us to cover a community that we were not a part of for the whole semester; I decided to report on the disabled community at GW. The class taught me the importance of listening, advocating and challenging your preconceived notions. Below is the op-ed I wrote for the class arguing for increased accessibility on GW’s campus. I spoke with members of the disabled community to learn more about their experiences with accessibility on campus, as well as GW administrators to understand what the school is doing to improve the quality of life for students with disabilities.\n\nNora Hoffman is a junior at George Washington University studying political science and english. She is hard of hearing. To accommodate her disability, GW provides live captioning done by a third party individual in her classes. The person doing live captioning is known as a communications access real-time translation, CART, provider.\nThe Friday before the start of the semester, Hoffman received an email from Disability Support Services alerting her that her captioner would be online for the entire semester. However, the technology needed for the CART provider to perform services online was not readily available.\nAccording to Hoffman, a mic and receiver are also necessary for the CART provider to caption virtually — it was not until 6 weeks into the semester that those tools were provided.\nHoffman replied to the email telling students the service would be online and asked why they hadn’t heard this earlier.\nDr. Maggie Butler, the Director Disability Support Services/Office of Diversity, Equity, and Community Engagement, called her on the phone in an attempt to explain the situation. Hoffman, who is hard of hearing, can not take phone calls.\nHoffman said that this action was a “disconnect” on behalf of DSS.\n“I just wish they would prioritize disabled students and accessibility more,” Hoffman said.\nWhen The George Washington University went online in March 2020, the administration quickly had to make adaptations and accommodations for “virtual learning.” The university remained operational entirely online for nearly two years. Throughout the period of virtual learning, accommodations were quickly made for the sake of both the physical and mental well-being of students at the university. These accommodations contributed to the wellbeing and academic success of students given the ongoing crisis of the Covid-19 pandemic.\nMany of these accommodations have remained or been adapted to in-person learning as the university came back in the fall of 2021. However, there are many students who have disabilities, both visible and invisible, that have needed similar accommodations well before March 2020.\nIt is imperative that the accommodations implemented as a result of the pandemic are maintained and supported despite the crisis no longer being as immediate.\nIn the past year, virtual learning accommodations have benefited the entire student population, demonstrating that accessibility improves everyone’s collective well-being. Accessibility for students with disabilities should not be implemented only when it assists the able-bodied majority on campus. It is too late for the administration to correct these wrongs in making appropriate accommodations for those who needed it prior to the pandemic; however, it is of the utmost importance that they continue making accessibility a priority as they have demonstrated in the past year. Furthermore, this is an opportunity for the university to expand accessibility on campus both inside and outside the classroom for those with physical or other disabilities.\nAccommodations such as having lecture slides posted to Blackboard was once seen as too much to ask for by students who faced physical limitations to being in the classroom. Now, GW requires professors to record and post lectures in case a sick student cannot come to class - even if “sick” is just a mild cold.\nShira Strongin is a senior at George Washington. She started school in the fall of 2017, but had to medically withdraw when she was unable to attend classes in person as a result of her chronic illness.\nWhen she started to miss classes her freshman year as a result of her illness, she said the administration at GW was unwilling to allow her professors to record lectures or send her class material such as lecture powerpoints. Those are both standard practices now.\n“When I was asking for these my freshmen year, none of this [the pandemic] had happened,” said Strongin. “They [the administration] said that they couldn’t and there was no precedent for it. And they were right about precedent, but they weren’t right about couldn’t. So now there’s no excuse.”\nStrongin said it is deeply frustrating to think back on all the excuses they gave to her when she was struggling.\n“There clearly were solutions, they just weren’t willing.” said Strongin.\nMany accommodations given the pandemic’s impact have carried over to in-person learning. Professors are regularly recording lectures and uploading recordings to Blackboard sites. This sort of standard-practice accommodation was not offered to those with disabilities who needed it before. Students and professors are also now required to wear masks to every class and in university buildings. More people wearing masks means less illness overall, especially during “sick seasons.” For students with compromised immune systems, this adaptation allows them to feel more comfortable in classrooms. These contrasts begs the question of why accessibility only becomes relevant when it means accessibility for abled-bodied individuals.\nBefore the shift in culture as a result of the pandemic, it was commonplace for students to present evidence such as a doctor’s note explaining why they had to miss class. This sort of behavior may be uncomfortable for students and also singles out those with disabilities - specifically those that they may not be particularly visible. Now, professors are much more accommodating toward students who feel sick to any degree. It has been common practice to skip class for something mild as a sore throat should so as to not put the entire class at risk for Covid-19.\nWhen Covid-19 sent students home abruptly in March 2020, the university granted a pass/no pass option with no limit on how many classes it could be applied to. Therefore, a student could take any class pass/no pass and had until the end of the grading period to decide. In the following academic year, GW maintained the policy but it was only applicable for one class. A pass/no pass meant that the grade would have no bearing on a student’s grade point average [GPA]. This accommodation helped students who may have been dealing with outside emotional stressors of being at home during the pandemic. It is naive of the university to think that now that classes are back in person, outside factors that may have made a student more inclined to take a class pass/no pass are suddenly non-existent. Therefore, the policy should still remain.\nThe change in culture and the adaption of many accommodations both through virtual learning and as the university has returned to in person learning is a result of the pandemic. Nonetheless, their ability to implement such accommodations for nearly 11,000 undergraduates makes it clear that they could have done so for the smaller, minority population of students with disabilities who would have benefited immensely from the expanded levels of accessibility. Their inability to do so is a reflection of systemic and institutional biases against students and people with disabilities. GW now has an opportunity to do better, and they should keep these accommodations in place and continue providing for students, both able-bodied and with disabilities, so as to provide the most accessible means of education for all individuals."

    "text": "## A new page featuring a sample “breaking news story” that is approximately 250 words and which features at least two pieces of information which are generated using inline R code within your Quarto document. In other words, an example would be “The election today resulted in ___ counties being won by the Republican candidate” where the __ is filled in on the fly by your inline R code. Note that to accomplish this your Quarto document will have to include the necessary R code chunks above to create the text or number objects you will insert into those spaces.Note that this is an example story you are writing - it can be based off of any dataset you choose to use, either one we’ve used previously or another you find. All elements needed to complete the code and the narrative must be part of your Quarto document, so whatever dataset you choose will need to be imported into the file at the top, etc, and then crunched appropriately to arrive at the number.To take a single value in a dataframe and convert it to a vector, you can use the pull() function if need be."
